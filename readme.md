# Reinforcement Learning Basics

In this repository, [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com) has been used to implement basic RL algorithms.

Implemented algorithms are: 

a) DP based policy iteration
b) DP based value iteration
c) Q-learning

The variations of results with respect to different parameters is also studied.
